# README
## To the file name (string-to-any-type-check-class-v1.py)
string-to-any-type-class.py

test data for input and status of output shown in the following block.
if __name__=='__main__': block.

It just checkes the string is valid and 
Strips the extra tab,newline,whitespace,single quote, double quote, parenthesis,square bracket, curly bracket.

However, my code is NOT completed.
I will complete the code so that it can achieve my goal as soon as possible.

### NOTICE
1. The introduction of the code.
         
          Iff there are NO exceptions after running this file, it refers that in this file, the string is valid 
          
          such that it can be converted into these types (int,string,set,tuple,list).

2. About the output in the console.

          If you don't want to see the annoying output for you, you can comment out the statements which print the results.
          
          For convenience to develop and debug for me, I print the results.

3. It is very,very IMPORTANT!!!

IMPORTANT!!!

IMPORTANT!!!

IMPORTANT!!!

         DON'T too rely the result from this code. Check the result once after one runs the code.
          
Although it took me more than one day to development and test these data then debug it (The data shows the comment after the main block 

for those data, see the topmost comment at this file) and, I will only test these data.

Therefore, I may miss some uncommon case. (I believe there is a little probability to get unexpected result in some uncommon case.)

4. It is also important. In this code, one just can

         1) Check the string is valid such that it can be converted into these types (int,string,set,tuple,list) withouut exception.
         
         P.S. It is very tough to me.
         
One can NOT

           1) Check the string can be converted into dict.
           Since I don't complete this part. It is the toughest part for me.
           
           2) Attempt to convert the string into other type.
         
5. Check these things.

            1) update and import the latest version of the module I used in the code.
            
 


### My goal
I hope I can complete these things in future version.
    
            1) Check the string can be converted to dict.
            2) Convert the string into these types.
