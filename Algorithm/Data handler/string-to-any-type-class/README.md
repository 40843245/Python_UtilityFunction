## To the file name (string-to-any-type-check-class-v1.py)
string-to-any-type-class.py

test data for input and status of output shown in the following block.
if __name__=='__main__': block.

It just checkes the string is valid and 
Strips the extra tab,newline,whitespace,single quote, double quote, parenthesis,square bracket, curly bracket.

However, my code is NOT completed.
I will complete the code so that it can achieve my goal as soon as possible.


## NOTICE

1. It is important.

    DON'T too rely the result from this code. Check the result once after one runs the code.
          
Although it took me more than one day to development and test these data then debug it (The data shows the comment after the main block 

for those data, see the topmost comment at this file) and, I will only test these data.

Therefore, I may miss some uncommon case. (I believe there is a little probability to get unexpected result in some uncommon case.)

2. In this code, one just can

    Check the string is valid such that it can be converted into these types (int,string,set,tuple,list).
